# When'sMyAnime

When'sMyAnime is a tool I created to change the date-time from GMT to a bunch of different local timezones.

## Why did I do it?

I have been working as a content writer focusing on Anime, it has become essential for me to convert the airing schedule of a particular show into various time zones frequently visited by readers of the blog site. In response to this need, I created When'sMyAnime, a convenient tool that allows me to convert a specific DateTime from GMT to the popular time zones needed by the blog I contribute to. This tool is beneficial not only for me but also for all the writers associated with that outlet.
The best part about the tool is that it exports an HTML Table that can be pasted directly unto the WordPress text editor.

## How to use the tool?

**STEP 1**: Open the website (duh ðŸ—¿)  
**STEP 2**: Convert the time of the event to GMT. To convert, you can utilize either an online converter or perform a simple calculation. For instance, if your time is in EDT, you can look up an online converter that can convert it to GMT for you. Alternatively, you can manually calculate the time difference to obtain the GMT equivalent.  
**STEP 3**: Enter the time in the big purple box (you cannot miss it, its massive).  
**STEP 4**: Hit submit.  
**STEP 5**: Once the table has generated, click on the pink Clipboard icon to copy the entire table onto your clipboard.  
**STEP 6**: Go to the markdown editor on WordPress where you are writing your blog and paste (_Ctrl+V_) it.
